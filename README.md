# Famous Probability Distributions: A Visual Guide [IN PROGRESS]

This guide was created as a resource for those wishing to learn more about the probability distributions that govern the statistics world. It is meant for those that are somewhat new to statistics and/or data science. In the process, this tutorial will help students visualize concepts using `ggplot`.

See the current website build [here](https://ben-j-wallace.github.io/probability-distributions/).
